Description: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Data Portal provides a
    platform for researchers to search, download, and analyze data
    sets generated by TCGA. It contains clinical information,
    genomic characterization data, and high level sequence analysis
    of the tumor genomes. The key is to understand genomics to
    improve cancer care. RTCGA package offers download and
    integration of the variety and volume of TCGA data using
    patient barcode key, what enables easier data possession. This
    may have an benefcial infuence on impact on development of
    science and improvement of patients' treatment. Furthermore,
    RTCGA package transforms TCGA data to tidy form which is
    convenient to use.
